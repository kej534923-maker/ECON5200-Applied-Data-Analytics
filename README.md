"I need a professional project description for my second lab: 'Deflating History with FRED'.

**What I did:**
* Objective: I built a Python pipeline to ingest live economic data from the Federal Reserve API to analyze wage stagnation and correct for statistical biases.
* Tech Stack: Python, fredapi, pandas, matplotlib.
* Methodology: 
  1. I fetched nominal wage data (AHETPI) and CPI data to calculate 'Real Wages.'
  2. I detected a statistical anomaly in 2020 (The Pandemic Spike).
  3. I fetched the Employment Cost Index (ECI) to control for the 'Composition Effect' and prove the spike was artificial.
* Key Findings: I visualized the 'Money Illusion'—showing flat real wages over 50 years. I also demonstrated that the 2020 wage boom was a statistical artifact caused by low-wage workers exiting the labor force, not a true increase in labor demand.

**Please write a README.md entry including:**
1. Title: The Illusion of Growth & The Composition Effect.
2. Objective.
3. Methodology (Highlighting the API usage and the ECI correction).
4. Key Findings (Focus on the 'Pandemic Paradox')."
