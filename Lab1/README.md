# 📊 Economic Data Science Portfolio

Welcome! This repository serves as my academic and applied data analytics portfolio for  
**ECON 5200: Applied Data Analytics in Economics**.

I am a graduate student in Economics with a strong interest in **Data Analysis, Economic Consulting, and Finance**, and this repository reflects my effort to bridge traditional economic theory with modern data science tools.

## 📌 About This Portfolio

This repository contains my coursework, labs, and applied projects from ECON 5200.  
The central goal of this course—and this portfolio—is to combine:

- **Causal inference and economic reasoning**  
- with **predictive analytics and machine learning techniques**

We follow a **Concept Extension** philosophy: starting from core statistical and econometric ideas (such as OLS regression and hypothesis testing), then extending them to more scalable and flexible methods (such as regularization and machine learning models).

Through these projects, I aim to demonstrate:
- Strong grounding in economic theory
- Hands-on data manipulation and modeling skills
- The ability to translate economic questions into data-driven insights

## 🧠 Skills & Methods Covered

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Regression & statistical inference
- Model evaluation and validation
- Regularization techniques (e.g., Lasso)
- Applied economic data analysis using real-world datasets

## 🚀 Looking Ahead

This repository will continue to evolve as I deepen my skills at the intersection of **economics, data analytics, and machine learning**.  
I welcome feedback, discussion, and collaboration.

Feel free to explore the notebooks and projects — thank you for visiting!
